We also maintain a <a href=\"https://github.com/ant-design-blazor/ant-design-blazor/labels/%F0%9F%8C%9F%20Q&amp;A\">FAQ issues label</a> for common github issues.</p>\n<p>If your question is style-related, please refer to the <a href=\"https://ant.design/docs/react/faq-cn\">list of frequently asked questions about Ant Design React</a>ã€‚</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><code>Select Dropdown DatePicker TimePicker Popover Popconfirm</code> disappears when I click another popup component inside it. How do I resolve this?</h3>\n<p>This is related to the scrolling area of the overlay, which by default only scrolls with the body.</p>\n<p>Use <code>&lt;Select PopupContainerSelector=&quot;#some-scroll-area&quot;&gt;</code> (<a href=\"https://antblazor.com/zh-CN/components/select#API\">API Documentation</a>) to render the component into the scroll area ( where <code>#some-scroll-area</code> is the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors\">CSS Selector</a> of the scrolling element).</p>\n<p>And make sure that <code>#some-scroll-area</code> element is <code>position: relative</code> or <code>position: absolute</code>.</p>\n<h3>How do I modify the default theme of Ant Design?</h3>\n<p>See: https://ant.design/docs/react/customize-theme .</p>\n<h3>Why does modifying props in mutable way not trigger a component update?</h3>\n<p>Blazor use shallow compare of props to optimize performance. You should always pass the new object when updating the state. Please ref <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/zh-cn/aspnet/core/blazor/components/lifecycle?view=aspnetcore-3.1&amp;WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-5003987#after-parameters-are-set-onparameterssetasync\">React's document</a></p>\n<h3>Components are not vertically aligned when placed in single row.</h3>\n<p>Try <a href=\"https://antblazor/components/space\">Space</a> component to make them aligned.</p>\n<h3><code>antd</code> doesn't work well in mobile.</h3>\n<p><code>antd</code> is not designed for mobile. There is also no Blazor implementation of AntDesign Mobile in development, so if you are interested in contributing code, please contact us.</p>\n<h3>Do you guys have any channel or website for submitting monetary donations, like through PayPal or Alipay?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://opencollective.com/ant-design-blazor\">https://opencollective.com/ant-design-blazor</a></p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Errors and Warnings</h2>\n<p>Here are some errors &amp; warnings that you may encounter while using AntDesign Blazor, although most of these are not actual bugs of antd itself.</p>\n<h3>Build error for Col components</h3>\n<p>Since the <code>Col</code> component is recognised by VS as a <code>col</code> element, you can use <code>AntDesign.Col</code> to avoid error.</p>\n<h3>Naming conflicts between the Column in the Form component and the Column in AntDesign Charts</h3>\n<p>It is also possible to use the namespace <code>AntDesign.Column</code> or <code>AntDesign.Charts.Column</code> to avoid error.</p>\n"
