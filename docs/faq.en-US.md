### `Select Dropdown DatePicker TimePicker Popover Popconfirm` disappears when I click another popup component inside it. How do I resolve this?

This is related to the scrolling area of the overlay, which by default only scrolls with the body.

Use `<Select PopupContainerSelector="#some-scroll-area">` ([API Documentation](https://antblazor.com/zh-CN/components/select#API)) to render the component into the scroll area ( where `#some-scroll-area` is the [CSS Selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors) of the scrolling element).

And make sure that `#some-scroll-area` element is `position: relative` or `position: absolute`.

### How do I modify the default theme of Ant Design?

See: https://ant.design/docs/react/customize-theme .

### Why does modifying props in mutable way not trigger a component update?

Blazor use shallow compare of props to optimize performance. You should always pass the new object when updating the state. Please ref [React's document](https://docs.microsoft.com/zh-cn/aspnet/core/blazor/components/lifecycle?view=aspnetcore-3.1&WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-5003987#after-parameters-are-set-onparameterssetasync)

### Components are not vertically aligned when placed in single row.

Try [Space](https://antblazor/components/space) component to make them aligned.

### `antd` doesn't work well in mobile.

`antd` is not designed for mobile. There is also no Blazor implementation of AntDesign Mobile in development, so if you are interested in contributing code, please contact us.

### Do you guys have any channel or website for submitting monetary donations, like through PayPal or Alipay?

## Errors and Warnings

Here are some errors & warnings that you may encounter while using AntDesign Blazor, although most of these are not actual bugs of antd itself.

### Build error for Col components

Since the `Col` component is recognised by VS as a `col` element, you can use `AntDesign.Col` to avoid error.

### Naming conflicts between the Column in the Form component and the Column in AntDesign Charts

It is also possible to use the namespace `AntDesign.Column` or `AntDesign.Charts.Column` to avoid error.
